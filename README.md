You can also make a French or Spanish version of the application. Just edit yesbot.py via IDLE. Instructions are included as comments in the file's code. You may also need to replace the "yes" voice with "yes" in the appropriate language. It is a wav file.

***Tormenting the Telemarketer***

Wait for the telemarketer or scammer to call you while you have `yesbot.py` running. When you answer their call, turn on speaker mode on your phone. Hold the phone's microphone close to the external speaker, and use the program to answer "yes" to every question.

Examples:

Note: You must use this program only for scambaiting. Please do not use it to make calls, but to answer calls. Phone scams with robots are against the US law, but scambaiting should be completely legal.
